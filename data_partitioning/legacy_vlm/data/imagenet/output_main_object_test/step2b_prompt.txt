You will be provided a list of [__LEN__] objects and the number of occurences in a given dataset. Your job is to cluster [__LEN__] words into [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__] categories. Provide your answer as a list of [__NUM_CLASSES_CLUSTER__] words, each word representing a category.

You must provide your answer in the following format "Answer {index}: {object}", where {index} is the index of the category and {object} is the object name representing the category. For example, if you think the first category is "object", then you should provide your answer as "Answer 1: object".

When categorizing the classes, consider the following criteria:
1. Merge similar clusters. For example, [sparrow, eagle, falcon, owl, hawk] should be combined into ’birds of prey.’
2. Clusters should be differentiated based on the nature of things.

Also, please provide a reason you chose the word for each category. You can provide your reason in the following format "Reason {index}: {reason}", where {index} is the index of the category and {reason} is the reason you chose the word for the category.
