After analyzing the list of labels, I have clustered them into 8 categories. Here are my answers:

Answer 1: Human
Answer 2: Animal
Answer 3: Vehicle
Answer 4: Buildings
Answer 5: Food
Answer 6: Landscape
Answer 7: Inanimate Object

Here are the reasons for each category:

Reason 1: I chose "Person" as the first category because it has the highest frequency (821) and is a distinct category that includes "People" and "Child".

Reason 2: I chose "Animal" as the second category because it encompasses a wide range of animals, including mammals ("Dog", "Cat", "Bear", "Lion", "Elephant", etc.), birds ("Bird"), and others ("Fish", "Frog", etc.).

Reason 3: I chose "Vehicle" as the third category because it includes various types of vehicles, such as "Car", "Bus", "Train", "Tractor", "Boat", "Van", and "Truck".

Reason 4: I chose "Structure" as the fourth category because it includes buildings and other constructed objects, such as "Bridge", "Tower", "Building", "House", "Barn", and "Archway".

Reason 5: I chose "Food" as the fifth category because it includes edible items, such as "Pizza", "Orange", and "Pomegranate".

Reason 6: I chose "Insect" as the sixth category because it includes various types of insects, such as "Butterfly", "Bee", "Ladybug", "Fly", and "Grasshopper".

Reason 7: I chose "Object" as the seventh category because it includes a wide range of objects, such as "Bottle", "Plate", "Cup", "Chair", "Table", and "Lamp".

Reason 8: I chose "Landscape" as the eighth category because it includes natural environments, such as "Mountain", "Beach", and "Fountain".

Note that some labels could fit into more than one category, but I have assigned them to the one that seems most relevant.
